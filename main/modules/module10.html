        <p class="mod10">Looking at my current HTML and CSS files I think I've done well in keeping content and design seperated. </p>
        <p class="mod10">To the right is a snippet of HTML from my main landing page of my portfolio. As you can see, there are 
         no references to the design of any of the content on the page. I made sure to not put things like "text-align" or "font-size"
         or "color" in any of my html elements. As you can see the section containing my introductory paragraphs have no design
         elements in them, and even has an id on one of the paragraphs, so I can easily select and add different design aspects to
         it. Inside my css files however, there are many tags that tell the section what to look like. I have  things like "background: #E0DDDD;
	         width: 400px; height: 330px; float: right; padding: 10px;" and so on. 
        </p>
        <p>Overall I think I have effectively creating a gap between structure and design through my seperate html and css files.</p>
