     <section id="mod11"> <p class="mod10">My SCRUM team consitsted of myself, Cailin, and Natalie. We all brought unique portfolios to the
     group, and different problems we worked through. Natalie had a problem with her navigation bar, and we helped her
     figure that out. I shared with Cailin the code to show a PDF in your html. They both gave me suggestions as to 
     how to condense some of my pages, as I had quite a few. Of course, we all used you as a resource. There were a few things, especially with Natalie's nav bar that 
     we couldn't find the errors in. </p>
     <p class="mod10">I think we spent our time very effectively in the workshop days. We quickly and effiently showed our pages, addressed the
     problems, made suggestions and then worked individually on those suggestions. </p>
     <p class="mod10">Most of my support came from the internet. I did much of my coding outside of class on my own, and when I ran into a 
     problem I would just google it. Or even if I didn't have a problem, but just wanted to learn something, I would turn to
     others experiences online. For example, I looked up how to embedd PDFs, and how to play videos within the site. I did
     occassionally ask you some questions that pertained more specifically to what we were doing in class. I also asked my
     computer science major friend a few questions when I was stuck and couldn't find my error.</p>
